An HTML/CSS website template for YFD Conferences.



## Editing the Template

If you have not edited HTML/CSS to design a webpage before, 
I encourage you to read 
[How to Build a Personal Webpage from Scratch](https://rutar.org/writing/how-to-build-a-personal-webpage-from-scratch/)
by Alex Rutar, particularly the 
[Crash course in HTML and CSS](https://rutar.org/writing/how-to-build-a-personal-webpage-from-scratch/#crash-course-in-html-and-css) 
section.


in the `<head>` of the HTML file. Then math can by typeset by using LaTeX's math notation enclosed in `\(...\)` delimiters.

## Sitemap (optional)

The file `sitemap.xml` helps search engines understand the structure of your site.
In this file, each instance of "WEBSITE" should be replaced
with the actual address where this website is being hosted.
See the [sitemaps protocol page](https://www.sitemaps.org/protocol.html) for more details.

## Alternatives

The simplicity of the HTML/CSS source for this template is its strongest feature.
For something more slick or modern or sophisticated or complicated:

 - [Hoverboard](https://github.com/gdg-x/hoverboard) is beautiful but requires some tech know-how to setup. 

 - You can build something from scratch based on a 
 [GitHub Pages site with Jekyll](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll) 
 or a template from [Pixelarity](https://pixelarity.com).
